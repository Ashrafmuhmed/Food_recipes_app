# food_recipes_app
- The food recipes application retrieves a wide variety of food names and instructional videos from the [TheMealDB API](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php). These recipes are organized by country, with each dish representing a specific nation.
- I used Flutter framework for building the user interface and Dart programming language .
